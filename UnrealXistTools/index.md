[UnrealXistTools](https://github.com/XistGG/UnrealXistTools)
is a set of PowerShell 7 scripts for UE5 developers.

Currently this is only used in Windows, though it may also work for Mac or Linux.
I generally try to write software that works everywhere,
but I haven't actually tested Mac or Linux.

At the very least it should be very easy for you to find/fix any alt-platform
issues you may experience.  I will gladly accept PRs for these as well.
